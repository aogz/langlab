## The Challenge: Immersive Learning, Interrupted

Language learners thrive on immersion. Reading articles, blogs, and news in a target language is one of the most effective ways to build vocabulary and understanding. However, the constant need to switch tabs to look up unknown words breaks the flow, disrupts concentration, and makes the learning process feel disjointed and frustrating.

## Our Solution: The Web Is Your Classroom

**LangLab** is a Chrome extension that transforms any webpage into an interactive language-learning playground. It turns the content you already love‚Äîarticles, blogs, and stories‚Äîinto your next lesson. With powerful, on-device AI, you can translate words, get grammar explanations, and even ask questions about the text and images without ever leaving the page. No more copy-pasting, no more context switching. Just pure, uninterrupted immersion.

Hold down a key, select the words you don't know, and get an instant translation in a clean, unobtrusive sidebar. It's that simple.
